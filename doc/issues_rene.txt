When airspaces of the same type are located above each other  not always the correct information is given on the garmin gps
at the cursor.
At the cursor, information of the lowest Airspace with floor should be displayed. Somtimes that does not happen. 
There is now a drawing order in which the type of airspace is of interest. 
The height difference should be added to the drawing order too. Example is the TMA Eindhoven.
